        <h1> Quantum Field Theory </h1>
        <h3> November 25th, 2025</h3>
        <h4> I started to explore Perturbation Theory, but realized that it may be benefical to re-learn the manual process of solving the Hydrogen atom via Schrodinger's equation. Here, I found another interesting concept to simplify a two-body system to a one-body system, which is the reduced mass. Here, you simply: </h4>
        <h4> 1. Assume Newton's 2nd and 3rd Law of Motion <br> 2. Find the total mass with respect to the "relative acceleration" of the system. Think of it as a Legendre transformation of shifting from thinking in terms of (x_1, x_2) to (x_1-2). <br> 3. Solve for reduced mass. </h4>
        <h4>After the reduced mass, you can strart solving for the Schrodinger's equation, assuming the central potential of Coloumb's attraction. After converting the equation to spherical coordinates, you get a rather complicated equation. From here, I will solve again tomorrow.</h4>

        <h4> In the process of searching up proofs for the reduced mass, I have also found the Lagrangian interpretation. To find the difference between the Newtonian and the Lagrangian interpretations, you have the think about the Principle of Least Action and General Relativity. In Newtonian Mechanics, you define a "force" by observing the difference in <br> </h4>
        <h4> position that is caused by the force. The difference from its inertial frame is the "movement" and this "movement" characterizes the force and vise versa. However, this starts to fail for the force of gravity. Consider Einstein's Elevator. If you were in a rocket that was accelerating at 9.8 ms^-2, dropping a ball would have the same trajectory as when you drop a ball on the surface of the Earth. <br></h4>
        <h4> Thus, the "movement" can no longer characterize the force as the same force resulted in a different result. This allows for a new concept to unfold, which is the light cone. The light cone shows that at the Horizon, events can influence event A or event A can influence other events. Both are possible. However, outside of a certain curve, this is no longer possible. This curvature is specifically caused by matter and anything that has mass. <br> </h4>
        <h4> This is because all action follows the path of a geodesic to draw a path of shortest "distance," which may appear curved in space, but is a straight line in spacetime. Thus, it proves that the presence of mass curves spacetime and forces the object to appear as if it is following a curved path when in fact it is on a straight geodesic. </h4>
